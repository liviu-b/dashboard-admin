- Manager: Limited access to certain data and user management features.
- User: Basic access to view data and limited actions.
  Customizing
  You can modify and extend the dashboard by adding new modules or components. The project is designed with modularity in mind, so adding new features is straightforward. Refer to the code structure in the `src/` folder for a guide on where to add new features.
